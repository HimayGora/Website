This isn't just a new phrase, but a recognition of the simple truth that our best ideas come to life when we build them together. It’s our commitment to making collaborative creativity the cornerstone of our work.</p>
                        <p class="my-4">In practice, this means creating more opportunities for your expertise to shine across teams. Think of the last project that felt truly seamless—where marketing insights helped shape an engineering solution, or customer feedback directly inspired a new feature. That is the spirit we are capturing. It’s about merging our diverse talents not just to be more efficient, but to make our work more impactful and rewarding for everyone involved.</p>
                        <p class="my-4">Let's make this value a visible part of our culture. I encourage you to reach across aisles, share your perspective freely, and listen with the intent to build on the ideas of others. Together, let’s make our collective genius our greatest asset.</p>

...
Tone/Style: Use a warm, clear, and very reassuring tone. Aim for language that feels like a natural, helpful conversation...
Negative Constraints: ...Do not use exclamation points (they can sometimes feel forced). Do not be overly friendly.</code></pre>

                        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The key to success here was the negative constraint: "Do not use exclamation points." This is a subtle but powerful instruction that forces the AI to convey friendliness through word choice alone, resulting in a more natural and less forced tone than the initial attempt.</p>
